# 📊 Lamina — Crypto Portfolio Dashboard

**Lamina** is a minimal crypto dashboard prototype built with **Next.js** and **ShadCN UI**. It visualizes a static crypto asset dataset stored in a local JSON file, which is delivered to the UI through **Next.js API routes**. This structure simulates a future-ready backend while keeping development lightweight and fast.

The project focuses on clean interface design, modular components, and scalable architecture — providing a strong foundation for future upgrades such as real-time market data or wallet integration.
